## Publications Export for Users

## Single Publication

- If you wish to download a publication, you can visit the webpage of the particular publication. On this webpage, you will find this dropdown - <br>
![publication drop-down](/cdli-docs/images/publication-dd-user.png)
On hovering, the drop-down looks like this - <br>

- Upon hovering on the drop-down, you will get a list of all the formats in which you can download the data of the publication.

- The data can be downloaded by simply clicking on one of the links.

- The bibliographical data can be downloaded from the `"Cite this Publication"` section at the bottom of the page.

## Multiple Publications

- Similarly, if you want to download data of multiple publications, you may visit the index page of publications. Here you will see a drop-down with two columns `"Download current page"` and `"Download all results"`- <br>

- Here, in most cases you may not be able to download all results as the data would be too large. 

- If you wish to download all results, you can search for specific publications using the form provided on the page to narrow down the results. Now, if the search results are less than or equal to 1000, you may download the data from the `"Download all results"` column of the drop-down.

- If the results are more than 1000, the `"Download all results"` column will change and the drop-down will look like this - <br>
