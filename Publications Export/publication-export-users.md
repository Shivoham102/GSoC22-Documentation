## Publications Export for Users

## Single Publication

- If you wish to download a publication, you can visit the webpage of the particular publication. On this webpage, you will find this dropdown : <br>
![publication drop-down](/cdli-docs/images/publication-dd-user.png)
On hovering, the drop-down looks like this: <br>
![publication drop-down](/cdli-docs/images/publication-dd.png)

- Upon hovering on the drop-down, you will get a list of all the formats in which you can download the data of the publication.

- The data can be downloaded by simply clicking on one of the links.

- The bibliographical data can be downloaded from the `"Cite this Publication"` section at the bottom of the page.

## Multiple Publications

- Similarly, if you want to download data of multiple publications, you may visit the index page of publications. Here too, you will see a drop-down like the above.

- But, the data for all the publications cannot be downloaded in one go as the data is too large. You may only download the publications on the current page (results displayed in the table).

- If you wish to download more publications than this, you can search for specific publications using the form provided on the page to narrow down the results. Now, if the search results are less than or equal to 1000, you may download the data from the drop-down.

- If the results are more than 1000 upon clicking `"Download Publications"`, a modal like this will popup : 
![Github link modal](/cdli-docs/images/publications-modal.png)

- This will show you a link to our Github data repository. You can visit github and download more data from there.
