## Publications Export for Editors

- Just like other entities, you will not need to login to download publication data.

## Single Publication

- To download the data of a single publication, you can visit the webpage of a particular publication by using a link similar to this - https://cdli.ucla.edu/publications/1, here you can replace "1" with the id of the publication you want.

- On visiting the page, you will see a drop-down, that says `"Download Publication"` - <br>
![publication drop-down](/cdli-docs/images/publication-dd.png)

- Now if you hover on this dropdown, you will get a list of all the formats in which you can download the data of the publication. These formats are as follows:
  - Flat Data
    - CSV
    - TSV
    - TXT
  - Linked Data
    - TTL
    - RDF-JSON
  - Expanded Data 
    - JSON

- The data can be downloaded by simply clicking on one of the links. The bibliographical data can be downloaded from the `"Cite this Publication"` section at the bottom of the page.

## Multiple Publications

- To download data of a number of publications, you can visit the index page here - https://cdli.ucla.edu/publications. Here you will see a drop-down like this - <br>
![publications index drop-down](/cdli-docs/images/publications-dd-1.png)

- Here, in most cases you may not be able to download all results as the data would be too large. 

- If you wish to download more publications than this, you can search for specific publications using the form provided on the page to narrow down the results. Now, if the search results are less than or equal to 1000, you may download all of the data from the `"Download all results"` column of the drop-down.

- If the results are more than 1000, the `"Download all results"` column will change and the drop-down will look like this - <br>

- This will show you a link to our Github data repository. You can visit github and download more data from there.
