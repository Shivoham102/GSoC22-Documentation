<h1>Retired Artifacts for Editors</h1>

To retire or un-retired an artifacts you will need to visit the artifact edit form. The link for the same is like http://127.0.0.1:2354/artifacts/edit/ID. You can add the the id of the artifact you want to edit in place of "ID" in the link.

1. When you visit the edit form of an artifact that is not yet retired and scroll down a bit, the retired section will look something like this -
![toggle off](toggle_off.png) <br>
Here, the toggle is off and hence the fields are disabled. When the toggle is clicked, the two fields will be enabled as in the image below, and you can enter the values that you want. <br>
![toggle on](toggle_on.png)

Then finally, when you hit the save button, you will be redirected to artifacts-updates/add view for the changes you made. Here you can confirm your changes or discard them.
