<h2>Retired Artifacts for Editors</h2>

To retire or un-retired an artifacts you will need to visit the artifact edit form. The link for the same is like https://cdli.ucla.edu/artifacs/edit/1. You can add the the id of the artifact you want to edit in place of '1' in the link.

1. When you visit the edit form of an artifact that is not yet retired and scroll down a bit, the retired section will look something like this -
![toggle off](toggle_off.png) <br>
Here, the toggle is off and hence the fields are disabled. When the toggle is clicked, the two fields will be enabled as in the image below, and you can enter the values that you want. <br>
![toggle on](toggle_on.png)

Then finally, when you hit the save button, you will be redirected to artifacts-updates/add view for the changes you made. Here you can confirm your changes or discard them.

2. To un-retire an artifact you simply need to turn off the toggle and the artifact will be un-retired. Rest of the process is same as above.

3. Whenever an artifact is retired, it will not appear in search results.

4. Also, when you link to the single view of a retired artifact you will be redirected either to the single view of the artifact with the id that was entered while retiring it, or if it doesn't have a redirect id you will be redirected to the home page. In both these cases, a flash message will be shown as to why you were redirected.

5. The flash messages look like this <br>
