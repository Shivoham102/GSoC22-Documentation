## Bulk Update for Editors

If you want to update a number of artifacts with a common attribute like designation, then you would want to use the bulk update feature. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. Visit the home page and search for the artifacts you want. (Say if the common attribute is a designation, you may search that).
2. On searching, you will be redirected to the search results page, here you can find the button `"Bulk Update"` below the `"Download Page"` drop-down.
3. On clicking this button, a modal will open with the fields that can be bulk updated. Choose the fields you want and click on `"Bulk Update"` in the modal. The modal should look something like this - [INSERT IMAGE]
4. You will be taken to the bulk update page. You will find the fields you selected at the top in a form. Upon filling these fields with the value you want click on save. Your changes to the fields will be applied to all the artifacts.
5. Below this form is a table with all the artifacts of the search results.
