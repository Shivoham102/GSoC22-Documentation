If you have artifacts with a common attribute like designation, and you wish to update some other attribute of these artifacts with the same value, follow the steps below:

1. Visit the home page and search for the artifacts you want. (Say if the common attribute is a designation, you may search that).
2. On searching, you will be redirected to the search results page, here you can find the button `"Bulk Update"` below the `"Download Page"` drop-down.
3. On clicking this button, a modal will open with the fields that can be bulk updated. Choose the fields you want and click on `"Bulk Update"` in the moda.
4. You will be taken to the bulk update page. You will find the fields you selected at the top in a form. Upon filling these fields with the value you want click on save. Your changes to the fields will be applied to all the artifacts.
5. Below this form is a table with all the artifacts of the search results.
