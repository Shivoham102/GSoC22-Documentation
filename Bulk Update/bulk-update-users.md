## Bulk Update for Users

If you want to modify a large number of artifacts based on a common attribute and apply the same values to all of them, follow the steps below:

1. Visit the home page and search for the artifacts you want. (Say if the common attribute is a designation, you may search that).

2. On searching, you will be redirected to the search results page. Here you can find the `"Update Search Results Metadata"` link at the bottom of the `"Advanced Features"` section on the left side. This section looks like this - <br>

3. On clicking this, a modal will open with the fields that can be bulk updated. Choose the fields you want and click on `"Bulk Update"` in the modal. The modal should look something like this - <br>

4. You will be taken to the bulk update page. You will find the fields you selected at the top in a form. Upon filling these fields with the value you want click on save. Your changes to the fields will be applied to all the artifacts.

5. Below this form is a table with all the artifacts of the search results.
